I got started on the schematic and learn the basics on how to import parts, assign schematics, and all of the good stuff. I finished it schematic in around 1-2 hours.
Then I tried to get started on the PCB itself, self gave up pretty quickly (2.3hrs)

I fianlly finshed it! The PCB is done! only took me like 2 hours. I was having some problems with the Skillscreen and the grid system not aligning, but I figured it out at the end! (2.5 hrs)

July 1 - deadline day
Today I have to make the case! The hardest part is that I spent way too long trying to set up Fusion WakaTime, and after setting it up, it still did not work. I just ended up making the case without it :(. I for my life count not align the USB-C port, so I just used a ballpark number and it worked! (3+hrs)

I updated my PCB and my schematic because the older version was not different enough to count
