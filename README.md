A small MacPad for copying and pasting this macro pad cuts the key input in half by 4 keys to 2 KEYS i just remove the need for Ctrl + C and Ctrl + v!
I hated that I had to spend 3 sec of my life copying and pasteing stuff useing Ctrl + C and Ctrl + v so i came up with this now it only takes me about 6 sec!
